                    </div>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
                        <p>A new server patch has been deployed, incorporating the latest updates and stability improvements from the latest commits to the master branch. Please see the summary of changes below.</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">New & Updated Systems</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ranches Open by Default:</strong> Based on a recent community poll, ranches are now unlocked by default. You can still choose to lock your ranch if you wish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Messenger Implementation (WIP):</strong> This is the first implementation of the friends list. It currently serves as a simple list of online ranches/players you can visit by clicking on an icon next to their name. It serves no other functionality as of right now, so adding friends, chatting, or sending emails will not work. It's a simple and better alternative to the <code>//visit</code> command.</li>
                            <li><strong>Incubator Implementation (WIP):</strong> You can now incubate and hatch eggs! Because of this, you will no longer be able to give yourself a pet directly via the <code>//give</code> command, only eggs. Fear not, as the boost logic isn't fully implemented so you can boost your egg hatch infinitely until it's ready to hatch, and you won't get any refined crystals deducted as of right now either. So boost to your heart's desire! **NOTE OF A BUG!/incomplete feature:** Once you acquire the pet from the egg, summoning it will not summon the pet until you restart the client; however, if you wish to un-summon the pet, that will work without restarting. You can find the list of all of the eggs that you can give yourself as well as generate the give command on this website: <a href="https://samuelll41.io/alicia/">https://samuelll41.github.io/alicia/</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>New Item Presets Command:</strong> The <code>//give</code> command has a new sub-command "preset". You can choose from a variety of item presets for a quick give-all. Currently, you can choose from these presets:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>feed:</strong> all feed items</li>
                                    <li><strong>clean:</strong> all wash items</li>
                                    <li><strong>play:</strong> all play items</li>
                                    <li><strong>cure:</strong> all cure items</li>
                                    <li><strong>construct:</strong> all construct/housing related items</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Example usage:</strong> <code>//give preset feed</code></p>
                                <p><strong>Note:</strong> A client restart is required to see the items given by this command.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Horse Stamina Implementation:</strong> Horse stamina can now be refilled and will correctly deduct the amount of carrots from the player.</li>
                            <li><strong>Character Information:</strong> Stats in the character info menu have been identified and are ready for future use, but for now, all are set to 0.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Guild Implementation Improvements</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Initial Guild Ranking Implementation:</strong> An initial guild ranking system has been implemented for future use but currently does not have any functionality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leave Guild:</strong> You can now leave a guild. (The cooldown for joining/creating a new guild is not yet implemented.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Guild Creation Fee:</strong> Creating a guild will now correctly deduct 3,000 carrots from the player and correctly update their current carrot amount.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Bug Fixes & Improvements</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Horse Stats:</strong> Fixed incorrect assignment of some horse stats.</li>
                            <li><strong>Housing:</strong> General improvements have been made to the housing implementation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The storage system will now display the correct timestamp for when a gift has arrived, and a notification will pop up above the inventory.</li>
                            <li><strong>General Improvements:</strong> General improvements to bug fixes have been implemented.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mt-6 mb-2">Notice: data has been wiped!</h3>
                        <p>Please be advised that all player data has been wiped. This was a necessary step to accommodate ongoing development and recent server-side changes. As the project evolves, further data wipes will be required periodically to support future updates.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ranch Lock:</strong> Ranch locking has been implemented. You can now lock your ranch to prevent other users from visiting. We have decided to make ranches locked by default for now to prevent potential harassment as well as to protect player's privacy and other issues. You can permanently unlock your ranch if you wish to do so.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pets (in testing):</strong> An early implementation of pets has been added to the server. You can now give yourself a pet using the <code>/give</code> command and summon it via the pet encyclopedia. Please note that egg hatching and renaming pets have not yet been implemented.

                        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
                        <p>Today marks a huge step forward for the server with the release of a brand new launcher and major quality-of-life updates. Please see the summary of changes below.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Launcher & Website Overhaul</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>New Story of Alicia Launcher:</strong> The old method of joining the server is now replaced! The new launcher makes joining easier than ever. Simply download the installer from the "Play" page, register an account, and click "Start Game". Your browser will prompt you to open the launcher, which will automatically log you in and connect you to the server. (OG Alicians might remember this "Web Launch" feature—it's back and better than ever!)</li>
                            <li><strong>Password Hashing & Auto-Conversion:</strong> The new launcher and backend system finally allow us to securely hash all passwords. For players registered before this update, your accounts have been automatically converted to the new format. You can log in with your old username and password right away!</li>
                            <li><strong>Website Redesign:</strong> The website has been updated to support this new, streamlined login flow, providing a much easier player experience.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Server & Game Updates</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>More Ranch Animals:</strong> The client packaged with the new installer includes more ambient animals on the ranch, such as deers, eagles, and the cat!</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved English Translations:</strong> The new client also includes updated translations, converting more of the original Korean text to English.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ranch XP Fix:</strong> An issue with Ranch XP has been patched. All buildings and structures in the Ranch Management tab should now be buildable without being incorrectly level-locked.</li>
                            <li><strong>Horse Armor Fix:</strong> A bug that caused horse armor to expire immediately or be un-equippable has been fixed.</li>
                            <li><strong>General Improvements:</strong> This update also includes numerous other background bug fixes and server stability improvements.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Community Tools</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ranch Swapper Tool:</strong> For those interested in exploring, I've created a simple Python script to replace your default ranch with a race map or other special map. You can find it on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/Chrommd/SoA-Ranch-Swapper/releases/tag/Release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoA Ranch Swapper</a>.</li>

                        <p>No data wipe was required for this update. All player data remains intact.</p>

                            <li><strong>Initial Guild Implementation:</strong> Guilds have been partially implemented. You can now create a guild, which will appear as a cosmetic title above your character. Full guild management (inviting members, changing banners, etc.) is not yet available. Please note there is no duplication check, so friends can create guilds with the same name to appear as if you're in the same guild. yay!</li>
                            <li><strong>Game Master System:</strong> Game Masters can now control system content. For now, this includes the ability to kick players from ranches.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ranch Ownership Implemented:</strong> The ranch ownership system has been implemented. Previously, while your ranch displayed your name, you did not truly "own" it in the backend. This fundamental change properly assigns the ranch to your account and is crucial for enabling future ranch-related features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ranch Management Unlocked:</strong> With the new ownership system, the Ranch Management tab is now functional, allowing you to customize and decorate your ranch with various buildings and structures. Please note that as the player level function has not been implemented yet, some structures that require a certain level cannot be built.</li>
                            <li><strong>Horse Renaming Fix:</strong> Horses without a name can now be properly renamed. This applies to the initial naming prompt for the three horses you receive when creating a new character. The server now correctly handles this feature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visit Preference Fix:</strong> Corrected an issue with the <code>//visit</code> command where the visit preference was not resetting after use.</li>
                            <li><strong>Backend YAML Support:</strong> Added a new library to support YAML configurations, improving server-side data management for future updates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Director Fixes:</strong> Implemented several bug fixes and stability improvements to the data director.</li>
